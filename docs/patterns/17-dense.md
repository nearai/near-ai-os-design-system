# Dense and pro-tool patterns

Dense is the fourth density tier (NDS-10). It is for panels people work in for hours with many values in view: an agent's configuration, a model's parameters, the spans of a trace, an evaluation table, a run's log. The benchmark is the Unity Editor (Editor Foundations) and Unity App UI, the most fully documented dense desktop system available: 20px rows, 2px between fields, an 18 / 4 / 8 inspector inset and a 15px indent. This section maps those patterns onto the NEAR AI tokens and onto Apple and Material where they differ.

Apply `.nr-dense` to a panel's container. Components inside read the density properties: `--nr-h-control` and `--nr-h-row` become `size-control-dense` 20, `--nr-gap` becomes `space-2`, `--nr-target` becomes 20. Colors never change with density.

## When to use dense

Use it:
- In panels where the rows outnumber the window height at compact density, and people compare or tune many values (temperature, max output tokens, tool permissions, retry policy).
- In pointer-and-keyboard windows: macOS, the Windows and Linux shells, desktop web at expanded width and up.
- Inside one pane or panel at a time. The window's navigation, `Tabs`, `Toolbar` and `ActionBar` stay compact.

Never use it:
- On touch-first devices: phones, tablets without a pointer, visionOS. Touch floors never shrink. On the web, `@media (pointer: coarse)` removes `.nr-dense`.
- For first run, consent, settings, sign-in, or anything a person sees once.
- As the only option. Dense rows sit below WCAG 2.5.8's 24px target minimum, so dense is opt-in per panel or per person (View > Density: Compact, Dense) and compact is always one switch away.

| Measure | Compact (macOS default) | Dense | Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Control height | 28 | 20 | `size-control-large`, `size-control-dense` |
| Row height | 40 | 20 | `size-list-row`, `size-control-dense` |
| Between fields | 8 | 2 | `space-8`, `space-2` |
| Between groups | 10 to 20 | 8 | `card-gap`, `space-8` |
| Inspector inset | 16 sides, 18 top and bottom | 18 leading, 4 trailing, 8 top and bottom | `inspector-padding-x`, `inspector-padding-y`; `dense-padding-left`, `space-4`, `space-8` |
| Indent per level | 18 after an 8 inset | 15, six levels at most | `tree-indent`, `dense-indent` |
| Control radius | 11, capsules for buttons | 3 | `radius-control`, `radius-pill`; `radius-dense` |
| Labels and values | `mac-label` 12, `mac-body` 13 | 12 | `mac-label` on macOS; the same 12 step (`web-caption`) in the shells |
| Captions, status bar | `mac-caption` 11 | 11 on macOS, 12 in the shells | `mac-caption`; `web-caption` in the shells |
| Glyph | 16 | 16 | `size-glyph` |
| Pointer target | 28 | 20 visible; the hit area spans the row and its gap | `target-pointer`, `size-control-dense` |
| Tooltip width | 260 | 300 | `size-popover-width` |

A dense panel stays usable at 275 wide with no horizontal scrolling. Below that it collapses to a tab in its pane.

## Inspector and property panels

`PropertyInspector` is the dense inspector. It lists the properties of the selection as label and value rows.

1. **Object header.** A tool tile or glyph, the object's name in `mac-body-strong`, its type as a caption in `text-tertiary`, on a `card-quiet` band. Property rows sit directly on the pane, so the band marks the higher level.
2. **Section headers.** Each group is an `Expander` foldout. Header labels are bold; nothing else in the panel is, except overridden values.
3. **Property rows.** 20 high, `space-2` apart. The label column takes 33 to 40 percent of the width, at least 96, left-aligned, with no colon. The value column flexes. Every label has a `Tooltip`.
4. **Help box.** A message sits directly under the property it is about and pushes the rows below it down (see message tiers).
5. **Overridden values.** The label turns bold and gains a small `accent-soft` dot after it. The tooltip names the source ("Set on this run; the agent default is 0.2"), and the row's context menu offers Revert.

- Group in this order of preference: vertical space, a header, a foldout, then a `SegmentedControl` for up to four views at 275 wide. Use a container only when the group shares an interaction (a reorderable list with add and remove).
- Never put high-traffic properties inside a foldout, and never put a foldout inside a container.
- When a field has focus, its label turns `accent-text`, so the eye finds the active row in a long list.
- A value that can never be edited here is plain text in a `KeyValueList`, never a disabled field.

**Example.** An agent named Release notes writer: Model (`Select`), Temperature 0.7 (`NumberField` with a `Slider`), Max output tokens 4,096, Tools (web.search, repo.read in a reorderable list), Tool approval (Ask me, Automatic, Never), Retries 2. A Trace session span: Started 09:14, Duration 52 min, Tool Claude Code, Redactions 3, Proof verified.

[Unity Foundations: inspector, inheritance] [trace-commons: TracesInspectorHost.swift]

## Foldouts

- An `Expander` row: the chevron sits in the gutter, offset into the leading padding; then an optional glyph, then the label. Each nesting level indents `dense-indent` 15, six levels at most.
- In an inspector, the chevron and the label both toggle. In a tree, the chevron expands and the label selects.
- Option-click (Alt-click) a chevron to expand or collapse every level below it.
- The chevron turns 90 degrees on `duration-fast`; under Reduce Motion it jumps.
- Idle headers have no fill; under the pointer they take `row-hover`.
- Remember open and closed state per object type, per window.

## Numeric fields

`NumberField` in a dense panel:

- **Anatomy.** A scrubbable label; a 20 field on `field` with `radius-dense`; the unit after the value in `text-tertiary`; tabular figures (`nr-tabular`). Add a `Slider` when the range is bounded at both ends: the field sits at the trailing end and the slider flexes, with the same track length for every slider in the panel.
- **Scrubbing.** Dragging the label left or right changes the value; the pointer becomes the left-right resize shape. Shift multiplies the step by 10; Option or Alt divides it by 10.
- **Keys.** Up and Down nudge by one step, with the same Shift and Option multipliers. Return commits; Esc reverts; Tab commits and moves on.
- **Units.** The field shows its unit, accepts it typed, and converts compatible units on commit ("2 h" in a minutes field becomes 120 min).
- **Expressions.** Arithmetic is evaluated on commit: `1024*4` becomes 4,096. An expression that cannot be evaluated reverts and says why.
- **Bounds.** Clamp on commit and say so under the row ("The maximum for this model is 8,192.").
- **Vectors.** Multi-value fields put a short sub-label (X, Y, Z) before each box.
- Always show a value. Empty means mixed; a dash means unknown.

[Unity Foundations: numeric field, slider] [Unity App UI: numerical field]

## Mixed values

When several objects are selected, a field whose values differ shows that they differ. Unknown and mixed look different: unknown is a dash or the product's unknown word and is read-only (NDS-16); mixed means the service answered and the answers disagree.

| Control | Mixed display | On edit |
|---|---|---|
| `TextField`, `NumberField` | An empty field with the product's mixed word ("Mixed") as its placeholder | The typed value applies to every selected object |
| `Checkbox` | The mixed dash glyph, announced as mixed | The first click checks all |
| `Switch` | Not used; dense panels and multiple selections use a `Checkbox` | |
| `Select`, `SegmentedControl` | The mixed word, no segment selected | The choice applies to all |
| `Slider` | No thumb until the person drags; the field shows the mixed word | The dragged value applies to all |

- One edit to a mixed field is one undo entry for all objects. Esc leaves them mixed.
- A parent checkbox follows its children: checking it checks all, unchecking clears all, mixed children make it mixed.

[Unity Foundations: toggle] [Unity App UI: checkbox]

## Live and committed values

Every field reports two values: a live one while it is being edited and a committed one on Return, blur, slider release or picker close.

- Preview live values at once: the canvas, the chart, the token estimate.
- Create an undo entry only on commit, one per commit, named for the property ("Undo Temperature"). Typing, scrubbing and dragging compress into that one entry.
- Use a delayed field, which commits only on Return or blur, when applying is slow, costly or destructive (rerunning an evaluation, re-indexing a folder). Elsewhere, update live.
- Invalid input reverts to the last valid value on commit. While the field has focus it shows a 1px `critical` ring, and the reason appears under the row in `critical-text`.
- The Edit menu names the next undo. Undo and Redo buttons disable at the ends of the history.
- Changes an agent makes are undo entries too, batched per run ("Undo changes from run 14").

[Unity App UI: undo stack] [HIG: undo and redo]

## Docking panes and window types

A pro-tool window (an agent workbench: runs, transcript or canvas, inspector, console) docks several panels into the window.

- Each dock region is a `Pane` with the flat-glass geometry, `pane-gap` 10 apart. Dense changes what is inside a pane, never the pane itself.
- The gap is the splitter. It shows the resize pointer; double-click resets the default size; dragging below a panel's 275 minimum collapses it to a tab.
- Several panels can share a pane as `Tabs` in the pane header. Each pane has a More menu: Move to New Window, Close, Reset Layout.
- Layouts persist per window across restarts. Window > Reset Layout restores the default.

| Type | Component | Docks | Moves | Resizes | Closes on outside click | Blocks the window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Docked panel | `Pane` in the window | Yes | By its tab | Splitter | No | No |
| Floating panel | Panel torn off into its own window | Back into a pane | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Dropdown | `Menu`, `Select`, `Popover` | No | No | No | Yes | No |
| Utility panel | Find and replace, a detached model picker | No | Yes | Fixed | No | No; stays on top |
| Modal | `Modal` | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| Alert | `Modal` confirmation | No | No | No | No | Yes |

[Unity Foundations: windowing, overlays] [Unity App UI: split view]

## Toolbars that show only usable tools

- A panel's toolbar sits under its tabs and holds actions about that panel, never the person's whole task.
- Tool groups are contextual. A group appears when the selection or mode makes it usable and leaves when that changes (span tools appear when a span is selected). Global view options stay.
- Inside a group that is showing, a tool that cannot run right now is disabled with its reason in the tooltip; it is never hidden.
- Put high-traffic tools at the leading end and low-traffic ones at the trailing end. Group by kind (tools, toggles, view options) with `space-8` between groups, three groups at most.
- Dense tools are 20 square `IconButton`s with `radius-dense` and `toolbar-glyph`. A pressed toggle (Show redactions) takes `accent-tint` behind an `accent-text` glyph.
- As the panel narrows, the lowest-priority tools move into a More menu.
- Every tool is a registry command; its tooltip shows the label and the shortcut.

[Unity Foundations: toolbar, contextual tooling]

## Trees

A dense tree is a `ListRow` tree at 20 rows.

- Indent `dense-indent` 15 per level, six levels at most, with the chevron in the gutter. Labels are `mac-label`; only top-level containers are bold. Counts and durations sit at the trailing end in `text-secondary`, tabular.
- The tree is one tab stop. Up and Down move; Right expands, then moves to the first child; Left collapses, then moves to the parent; Home and End jump; typing jumps to a matching label; Return acts (in Trace, it opens the review).
- Shift-click selects a range; ⌘-click (Ctrl-click) toggles a row. Rename through the context menu or by double-clicking a selected label.
- The selected row takes `selection` with `text-on-accent`; hover takes `row-hover`, never over a selected row. Keyboard focus draws the ring around the tree.
- Expose tree semantics: tree and tree item roles, level, expanded state, position in set.
- Drag vertically to reorder and sideways to change the parent. The 2px `accent` insertion line starts with a small circle at the target depth.
- Virtualize long trees. A fixed row height makes it cheap.

Examples: Trace's folder and session tree; an agent run with its steps and tool calls.

[Unity Foundations: tree view, foldout] [trace-commons: TracesTree.swift]

## Tables

A dense `DataTable` at 20 rows:

- **Header.** Sticky (`z-sticky`) on the pane's hard scroll edge, so rows never show through. Labels in `mac-label`, `text-secondary`.
- **Rows.** A `hairline` between rows, never around the table. Hover takes `row-hover`; selection takes `selection`.
- **Sorting.** Clicking a sortable header sorts ascending, then descending; the arrow glyph follows the label. Shift-click adds a second key. Expose the order with `aria-sort` or the platform equivalent, and keep it per window.
- **Columns.** Resize by dragging the header edge; double-click fits the content. Reorder by dragging the header. Show or hide optional columns from the header's context menu.
- **Alignment.** Numbers align to the trailing edge in tabular figures; text to the leading edge. Figures that describe what leaves the device are monospaced.
- **Empty cells.** A cell without a value shows a dash, never zero.
- **Keyboard.** The grid is one tab stop. Arrow keys move the active row or cell; Return edits an editable cell; Esc reverts.
- Use columns, never tabs, when people compare values across items.

Example: the Private AI calls table, with Time (mono), Model, Tokens in, Tokens out and Proof (a `ProofTag`: verified, pending, no proof).

## Message tiers, status bar and console

Choose the tier by scope, then the tone by severity. Every message follows Problem, Cause, Solution, without an "Error:" prefix.

| Tier | Scope | Component | Behavior | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dialog | The whole app; blocks | `Modal` confirmation | One to three buttons, each a verb; rare | "Near.ai cannot start the watcher because the folder near-agents is no longer readable. Choose the folder again in Settings." |
| Banner | The window | `Toast`, or a window `Notice` | A toast fades after a time scaled to its length; a toast with an action stays until used or replaced; a notice stays until resolved | "Exported 214 calls to calls.csv." |
| Help box | A section or property | `InlineAlert`, or a small `Notice` under the control | Stays until resolved; 200 characters at most; one button that fixes it in place and one link to the docs | "Max output tokens is above this model's limit of 8,192. Lower it or choose another model." |
| Console | Operations over time | Status bar and console pane | Time-stamped entries; the status bar shows the latest; clicking it opens the console | "09:14:07 web.search returned 0 results." |

- Severity is a glyph plus words, never color alone. Critical means the operation will not complete; caution means it completes and may surprise; neutral is information.
- Empty states never use warning glyphs. An `EmptyState` explains the condition; a help box explains a failed recovery.

**Status bar.** A 20 strip at the bottom of a panel or window, in `mac-caption` (`web-caption` in the shells) and `text-secondary`. It holds brief status only (counts, last saved, the latest console line), because it can fall off-screen. Nothing critical lives there.

**Console pane.** Rows of 20 in `mac-mono` (`web-mono` in the shells) with columns for time, severity, source and message. Filter by severity with a `SegmentedControl`; search; Copy; Clear. Follow new lines only while the person is at the bottom; once they scroll up, never pull them back. Announce errors politely; never announce every line.

[Unity Foundations: errors and messaging, help box, empty states]

## Keyboard-first operation

- Every command is reachable from the keyboard, and its shortcut shows in menus, the palette and tooltips, all read from the registry.
- Tab moves through fields in reading order. Control-F6 (macOS) or F6 (Windows, Linux) moves between panels.
- Return commits a field, Esc reverts it, Space toggles a checkbox, arrow keys move in trees, tables and segmented controls.
- Esc steps out one level at a time: revert the field, leave the field, close the transient surface.
- ⌘[ and ⌘] (Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+] elsewhere) walk the selection history, up to 50 entries, with no duplicates and no animation.
- Type-ahead works in every list and tree. ⌘F filters the focused panel; Mod+K opens the palette.
- Single-key tool shortcuts work only while the canvas has focus, and people can remap them.
- The focus ring is the standard 2px `focus-ring`, 2px outside (NDS-5). In a dense panel it overlaps the 2px gap; draw it above the neighboring rows.

[Unity Foundations: accessibility, selection history]

## Tooltips

- Show after 0.4 s of hover or on keyboard focus. Moving straight to a neighbor that has a tooltip shows it at once. Hide at once when a drag starts or the pointer leaves for something without one. Stay while hovered.
- At most 300 wide, three lines, 200 characters, placed `space-10` below the element and centered, flipping at window edges.
- Write complete sentences. When the label is truncated, the first line repeats it in full; the description follows. The shortcut comes from the registry.
- Every inspector label and every icon-only control has one. An icon-only control's tooltip equals its accessible name.
- Draw tooltips on the floating layer with `z-tooltip`. Never put essential information only in a tooltip.

[Unity Foundations: tooltip]

## Hide or disable

- **Disable** a control when its value matters but cannot change now (it is set automatically, or the service has not answered), or when it is normally available and temporarily is not. Disable the whole control at `opacity-disabled` 0.45, with no hover, and give the reason in its tooltip or beside it.
- **Hide** a control that applies only in rare cases or whose value means nothing in the current state. A dependent control appears directly below the control that reveals it, ideally on the next line.
- Never hide a button to show state. An action the service does not offer for this item (Trace's Submit pill on a folder with nothing to submit) is absent; an action that applies but cannot run yet is disabled with a reason.
- Context menus hide what cannot run. The menu bar disables it. Tabs are never disabled.

## Reference measures from the Unity Editor kit

The Unity Editor UI Toolkit Figma library measures the Editor's own chrome. Use these figures when a dense panel must sit beside pro tools people already know.

| Element | Editor kit | Parent dense equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Value field | 18 high | 20 (`size-control-dense`); the 2px difference is the larger macOS label |
| Buttons | 18 / 20 / 24 (mini, regular, large) | 20 dense, 28 compact |
| Toolbar, tab strip, dock tab | 20 high; a search field shrinks to 16 inside | A dense `Toolbar` row is 28; inside a dense panel's own toolbar use 20 with a 16 `SearchField` |
| Tree and list rows | 16 | 20 (`ListRow` dense); 16 only for read-only logs |
| Property-row pitch | 20 (18 + 2) | 22 (20 + `space-2`) |
| Label column | About 120, or 33% for horizontal labels | 33 to 40 percent, at least 96 |
| Indent | 15 per level | `dense-indent` 15 |
| Object header, section header | 60, about 22 | Object header band 44; `Expander` header 22 |
| Type | Six sizes: 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 19 (Inter; 12 is the default, drawn at 11.5 to match the Editor) | `mac-micro` 10, `mac-caption` 11, `mac-label` 12, `mac-body` 13, `mac-title` 15, `mac-heading` 17 |

- **Depth by brightness, not shadows.** In the Editor's dark theme, value wells sit darker than the window (#2a2a2a on #383838) and buttons lighter (#585858). The parent does the same with `field` and `well` below the pane and `control` above it; dense panels never add shadows.
- **Hover is an overlay.** The Editor tints a hovered row with 6% white (dark) or black (light) so hover reads on zebra rows too; `row-hover` (5% white, 4% black) is the parent equivalent.
- **Focus has three cues.** A field border, a button ring and the focused field's label recolored. The parent keeps `focus-ring` and recolors the label to `accent-text`.
- **Selection follows window focus.** The Editor selects in blue (#2c5d87) only while its window is focused and in grey (#4d4d4d) otherwise, as Apple's unemphasized selection does. The parent keeps `selection` and dims the whole pane with `inactive-dim` in a background window; a separate unfocused-selection role is a candidate for a later version.
- **States.** Dense controls need the full set: default, hover, focused, focus and hover, pressed, pressed and focused, checked, selected, selected in an unfocused window, accepted (a valid drop target), invalid, mixed, disabled, loading.
- **Segmented groups** are built from leading, middle and trailing pieces that share borders and round only the outer corners. `SegmentedControl` in a dense panel follows this construction with `radius-dense`.
- **Toolbar separators** are 1px hairlines drawn inside the toolbar, never separate elements.
- **Window templates are variants, not layouts.** One "default window" covers most tools as background (plain, recessed, zebra) × tabs on or off × toolbar on or off × one to three panes. Build dense tool windows from the same switches.
- **Console counters.** A status bar shows counts by severity with a glyph each (info, warning, error); log rows are two lines with a severity glyph. Use this for agent run logs and trace spans, with `positive`, `caution` and `critical` marks and words.
- **Dialogs stay native.** Unity uses the operating system's menus, window frames and dialogs unchanged. Do the same; the parent restyles only what the app draws.

## Mapping onto Apple and Material

### The benchmark's conflicts, resolved

| # | Topic | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Depth | The content layer is flat with no shadows; hierarchy comes from fills (`card-quiet` bands) and hairlines. `shadow-float` belongs to panes and the floating layer only (NDS-2, NDS-9). |
| 2 | Corners | Pane geometry never changes; inside a dense panel, radius marks what is interactive: `radius-dense` 3 on controls, none on rows and groups. |
| 3 | Toggle naming | Name them `Checkbox` and `Switch`; dense panels use `Checkbox`, and `Switch` stays for settings that take effect at once outside dense panels. |
| 4 | Capitalization | Copy is written in sentence case (NDS-16); shells may set macOS and iPadOS menu-bar items in title case with the ellipsis, and nothing else. |
| 5 | Tooltip timing | 0.4 s in dense panels with instant hand-off and no auto-hide while hovered; the platform default elsewhere. |
| 6 | Toast stacking | One `Toast` per window at a time; a newer one replaces it, and a replaced Undo stays in Edit > Undo. |
| 7 | Tabs scope | `Tabs` navigate; `SegmentedControl` switches views inside a panel (four at most at 275 wide); neither is ever disabled. |
| 8 | Radio or dropdown | Two to five options inline (`RadioGroup` or `SegmentedControl`), six to fifteen in a `Select`, more than fifteen in a searchable `Select`. |
| 9 | Disabled styling | `opacity-disabled` 0.45 on the whole control on every platform, with the reason in words. |
| 10 | Target size | Dense controls are 20 tall with a hit area across the row and its gap; that is below WCAG 2.5.8's 24, so dense is opt-in, pointer-only and one switch from compact. |
| 11 | Dialog button order | Cancel leads and the primary trails (NDS-19); a destructive action takes the trailing place and is never the default (NDS-15); Esc cancels. |
| 12 | Links | Links leave the app or open documentation, in `accent-text` with an external glyph; moves inside the app use buttons, rows and breadcrumbs; underline on hover in dense chrome, at rest in running text on the web. |
| 13 | Status fill contrast | The NDS-6 floors hold with no overrides; status words use the `*-text` tokens and counts on `badge-fill` use `text-on-status`. |
| 14 | Type sizes | On macOS, 12 for labels and values (`mac-label`), 11 for captions and the status bar (`mac-caption`), 10 only for tags and chart ticks (`mac-micro`); the shells use the nearest `web-*` step; nothing smaller. |
| 15 | Icons | Vector glyphs from the icon registry at `size-glyph` 16 in dense and compact controls and 20 on touch toolbars, tinted by token, never bitmaps (see Iconography). |
| 16 | Text over glass | Dense rows sit on painted content inside a pane whose `glass-veil` holds 4.5:1 over the worst-case ground (NDS-6); dense text never sits straight on a blur. |

### Where the platforms differ

| Platform | Dense rendering |
|---|---|
| macOS | Native controls at the small control size inside dense panels; outline views at the small row size for trees; native menus. Sidebar row size follows the system setting, never the panel's density. |
| Windows, Linux shells | `.nr-dense` on panel containers; container queries enforce the 275 minimum; the forced-colors path still applies. |
| Desktop web | Same as the shells; `@media (pointer: coarse)` falls back to touch density. |
| iPadOS | No dense tier. With a pointer and keyboard attached, pro panels use compact. |
| Android | No dense tier; M3's 48dp target holds. Desktop windowing with a mouse uses regular density. |
| visionOS | Never dense; targets stay at `target-spatial` 60. |

See Layout, density and targets for the density properties, and Forms and data for field and table behavior at the other densities.
