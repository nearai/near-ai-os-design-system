# Design decisions from the product sessions (2026-09-15 to 2026-11-03)

The system's first version (2026-10-13) was derived from trace-commons' source code. Between 2026-09-15 and 2026-11-03 the owner designed three products in Claude Code sessions, and many of those decisions either came after the system was written or were never written into it. This note records where NDS-22 to NDS-49 came from, so a later reader can check them against their source.

## What was read

62 sessions, reduced to the owner's prompts and the assistant's replies (tool output dropped), about 2.9 MB of text. Each finding was checked against the product repositories on 2026-11-03.

| Product | Repository | Sessions | Dates | State checked against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gateway (the macOS app, called Trace until 2026-11-04; bundle "Near.ai") | trace-commons | 55 | 2026-09-15 to 11-03 | `main` at `e2a1ad9d7` (2026-11-03) |
| Private chat ("Private AI", "Near AI private Chat") | nearai/LibreChat | 5 | 2026-10-23 to 11-03 | PR #4 (proof seal) and PR #5 (Near AI OS shell), both open |
| Marketing site for the macOS app | nearai-gateway-website (was nearai-macos-website) | 2 | 2026-10-27 to 11-04 | `main` at `865dab2` |

## What was not adopted

- **The chat's breakpoints and drawer.** LibreChat keeps its stock 640 and 768 breakpoints and a navigation drawer below 768. The owner ruled on 2026-11-04 to leave them out of the system for now (NDS-49), so NDS-12 and NDS-13 stand.
- **The chat's stronger hover steps.** The owner asked for more contrast on list and picker selection; the chat drew opaque grey steps on its opaque shell. The parent's `row-hover` already matches the lighter step, so no role changed; an opaque shell steps its own greys.
- **The current chat as an accent tint.** The chat marks the open conversation with `accent-tint` instead of `selection`. The assistant chose it and the owner did not answer, so `Sidebar` records it as the chat's variant.
- **Marketing copy.** "Private by default, always" and "Paid with your Near AI credit" break app-surface rules; open question 8.
- **The Cyber-Classical app theme.** Scrapped (NDS-46). The site keeps its own Cyber-Classical-derived look under NDS-45.
- **Hero promotion gradients on Gateway's Home.** Shipped in trace-commons but not ruled on as a system rule; `Card` keeps "no two-hue gradient" and records Gateway's state.

## How to repeat this

Session transcripts live under `~/.claude/projects/<project>/*.jsonl`. Keep only `user` and `assistant` text blocks, drop tool results, read them in date order, and check each decision against the repository's `main`. Later sessions overrule earlier ones; a decision in an open PR is the owner's direction until the PR lands or is withdrawn.
